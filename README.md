# jsforce-sample

This is a simple interactive demonstration of how to use Salesforce with Node.js via a library called jsforce.  jsforce can be run via command line or used with server side solutions like express.

Node is required, obviously: https://nodejs.org/en/

You will also want a Developer Edition org (which are free and do not have a fixed expiration): https://developer.salesforce.com/signup

Then to install and run:

1. Clone or download this repository
2. In the repository directory run **npm install -local**
3. Modify config.json with the username and password for your Developer Edition.
4. Run **node index.js displayContactsSOQL** to see a list of contacts from your instance.

index.js will accept:
* displayContactsSOQL
* displayContactsEventMethod
* displayContactsMethodChain
* createContact
* updateContact
* deleteContact

In config.json, you can also set "deployToWeb" to be true to see a sample API call via express at /contacts.

If you are using a scratch org or sandbox, add "production" to config.json and set it to false.

All variables can be handled as environment variables as well, which will override config.json.

Comments within index.js point to specifics about the code.  Full documentation for jsforce can be found on the project site: https://jsforce.github.io/
